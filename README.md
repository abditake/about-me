# About-me
## I built a website called About-me . It creates prompts for the user to answer trivia questions about myself.It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

# Reflections and Comments
- The hardest part of this was probably setting up the html from just a few comments. I didn't know where to start or how it should look. I just happened to just get started. I feel like if i planned out what I wanted my about-me page to look like I would have been less nervous throughout the project. 
- used html to style a little better for the webpage.
- used javascript to make sure the questionnaire portion of my website ran correctly.
